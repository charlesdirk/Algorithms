This file contains code snippets for Learning MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL Database bases on files. It is Written in C++ and
runs on all major platforms.
In this Series I will Make a compariam between Relational Databases and 
NoSQL Databases as well as the different terms used.

TERMS:
	Database: This is used both is RDBMS and NoSQL Databases

	Tables -> Collections:
		Tables are used to hold the data in RDBMS while collections are used
		in MongoDB

		To create a table we use SQL(Structured query Language)  as 
		follows:

			CREATE TABLE table_name(options);
			where table_name is name of table and options include
			the table schema: column types and constraints.
		To create a collection in MongoDB we use the createCollection()
		function provided as follows:

			db.createCollection('Collection_name',options<optional>)

To show the tables or Collections available in the various databases,
we use the show command in either case.

	SHOW TABLES; For MariaDB

	show collections : for MongoDB

With our tables and Collections Setup, we can start populating them with data.
	In MariaDB we use the insert query to populate a table as follows:

		INSERT INTO table_name VALUES(data...,);

	In MongoDB we use the internal insert function on the collection object as follows:

		db.collection_name.insert(json_object);

To retrieve data from our tables and collections we use SELECT statements in MariaDB and find() function in MongoDB.

	SELECT * FROM table_name; Selects all fields from a table;

	db.collection_name.find(options<optional>) Retrieves all fields from a collection.
